          Some of the snapshot tests seem to have failed. Please:
          - Head over to the artifacts section of the [CI Run](https://github.com/loukwn/StageStepBar/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}).
          - Download the zip.
          - Unzip and you can find one or more images that show the expected and the actual test results.
          - If these changes are fixing an issue or are part of a new feature then please speak to the maintainer. If they are not intended then please fix them and repush again.
